<p>NEWS. This is the Estonian language version of a news podcast that I developed inspired by the BBC:s 'Global News Podcast'. I'm assisted in the studio by a intercultural language professional who has localised my orginal text from English to her own language. This podcast is an excellent example of merging multilingualism with audio production. <br> <br>The podcast was recorded in the early spring of 2020.</p>
