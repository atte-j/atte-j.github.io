<p>POLICY BRIEFING. This is an example of the audio briefings provided by the European Parliament for its MEPs and the public. For this particular program I utilised a structure that is often seen in news programs to make this rather complicated topic more comprehensible. The content is derrived from research material provided by EP Think Tank.

This program was produced in the late summer of 2019.</p>
