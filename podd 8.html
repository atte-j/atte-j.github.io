<div class=text><p>WHAT EUROPE DOES FOR ME. The European Parliament has created an online encyclopedia over the many projects it is supporting across the EU. This website is called 'What Europe does for me' and contains hundreds of articles in different languages about what the EU does in your region, for different social groups and in certain policy areas.

<br>
<br> In 2018, the Directorate-General for Translation of the Parliament started making podcast to support this project. For that we used our capacity for both audio and multilingualism. The result was a lot of podcast. 

Here is a demo version of an explainer-podcast I made for this project. Recorded in Luxembourg in 2019.</p></div>
