<p>EUROPE. This is a podcast that was recorded to capture the youthful spirit of the European Youth Event of 2018. The interviews are conducted in many different European languages with inspiring people from all over the EU. This particular version of the programme was put together in a simulated live-setting with soundbites and audioclips launched in realtime during the recording session. This program was produced in Luxembourg in 2018.</p>
